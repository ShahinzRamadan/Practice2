# üìëNotes
 ### about branch
  * you can't delete a branch while you're switched to it, you have to switch to another branch to delete the other one
  * *git branch -d BranchName* this command checks the branch you are trying to delete first and if it finds out that there are modifications that you didn't merge into the master branch it will refuse to delete it
  * *git branch -D BranchName* this command deletes the branch anyway
  * you have to switch to the master to merge a branch within 
### about stash
 * you will notice a pattern within the stash commands which is if you just write the command this means the command will work on the latest stash you've created, but if you need to work on a specific stash you need to explicitly write the stash id
 * *git stash branch BranchName* this command does several things:-
                                                                   1. create a new branch
                                                                   2. pop the files from the stash to the new branch
                                                                   3. switch to the new branch
